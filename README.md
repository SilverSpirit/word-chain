The aim of the game is to chain together as long a word as possible without completing it. Words of length four or higher from the standard list of Scrabble words are valid. You lose if you complete a word.

For each turn, you play a letter that gets added to the word. If you are "challenged", you must play a full word prefixed with the current set of letters. Similarly, if you suspect the other player is bluffing, you may issue a challenge as well. If the challenged player is able to play a valid word then they win, otherwise the challenger wins.

E.g. 1
- You play Y
- Computer plays E
- You play A
- Computer plays R and loses

E.g. 2
- Computer plays W
- You play A
- Computer plays T
- You challenge the computer
- Computer responds with WATCH and wins.!
